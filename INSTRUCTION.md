    - Implement drag-and-drop interfaces where applicable:
      - Use react-beautiful-dnd for lists and grids with a focus on animations and accessibility
      - Consider @dnd-kit/core for more complex use cases or when greater customization is needed
    - Ensure drag and drop is smooth, intuitive, and provides clear visual feedback
    - Use multi-touch gestures for mobile devices
    - Provide keyboard shortcuts for power users
    - Implement undo/redo functionality for drag and drop actions and live coding where appropriate

11. Sheet Music Features:
    - Use VexFlow as the primary library for rendering and manipulating standard music notation:
      - Create interactive exercises for note reading and writing
      - Implement dynamic score generation based on user input or algorithmic composition
    - Leverage OpenSheetMusicDisplay or OSMD for rendering MusicXML files:
      - Display full scores or excerpts from classical or popular music
      - Allow users to upload and render their own MusicXML files
    - Utilize abcjs for quickly rendering simple melodies or chord progressions:
      - Create interactive examples for harmonic analysis
      - Implement real-time rendering of user-input melodies

Remember to balance complexity with usability, ensuring the app remains accessible to beginners while offering depth for advanced users. Always prioritize the quality and effectiveness of visualizations and interactions, using the most appropriate tools for each specific use case.

# Tone.js usage tips:

1. Accurate Timing

Tone.js uses the Web Audio API for sample-accurate scheduling. If you are experiencing loose timing, double check that you are passing in the scheduled time the Transport provides into the event that you are scheduling:

INCORRECT:
```
Transport.schedule(() => {
  player.start();
}, 0);
```

CORRECT:
```
Transport.schedule((time) => {
  player.start(time);
}, 0);
```

Event Classes
This is similarly true for all of the event classes like Part, Sequence, Loop, Pattern, etc.

INCORRECT:
```
new Part((time, event) => {
  synth.triggerAttackRelease(event.note, event.duration);
}, events);
```

CORRECT:
```
new Part((time, event) => {
  synth.triggerAttackRelease(event.note, event.duration, time);
}, events);

2. Ensure you are preventing the "Max polyphony exceeded" error
