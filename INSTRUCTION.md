    - Use React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting
    - Optimize audio processing by reusing Tone.js objects when possible
    - Implement debounce or throttle for frequently called functions (e.g., audio parameter changes)

14. Tone.js and Web Audio API Best Practices:
    - Initialize Tone.js context only after user interaction:
      ```typescript
      const initAudio = async () => {
        await Tone.start();
        // Initialize your Tone.js instruments and effects here
      };

      // Call initAudio() after a user gesture, e.g., button click
      ```
    - Use React's useEffect hook to set up event listeners for initializing audio:
      ```typescript
      useEffect(() => {
        const handleFirstInteraction = () => {
          initAudio();
          window.removeEventListener('click', handleFirstInteraction);
        };
        window.addEventListener('click', handleFirstInteraction);
        return () => window.removeEventListener('click', handleFirstInteraction);
      }, []);
      ```
    - Avoid creating Tone.js instruments or effects in component render methods
    - Use React state to manage Tone.js objects:
      ```typescript
      const [synth, setSynth] = useState<Tone.Synth | null>(null);
      ```
    - Always check if audio objects are initialized before using them:
      ```typescript
      const playNote = (frequency: number) => {
        if (synth) {
          synth.triggerAttackRelease(frequency, '0.5');
        }
      };
      ```
    - Consider creating a custom hook for managing Tone.js initialization and state
    - Implement proper cleanup of Tone.js objects in useEffect cleanup functions
    - Use Tone.Transport for scheduling and timing-sensitive operations
    - Implement volume controls and a master mute button for user convenience
    - Always start Tone.js before creating or using any Tone.js objects:
      ```typescript
      const initAudio = async () => {
        await Tone.start();
        console.log('Audio is ready');
        // Only create Tone.js objects after this point
        const synth = new Tone.Synth().toDestination();
        setSynth(synth);
      };
      ```
    - Implement a user interface element (e.g., a "Start Audio" button) to trigger audio initialization:
      ```typescript
      const AudioInitButton: React.FC = () => {
        const [isAudioReady, setIsAudioReady] = useState(false);
        
        const handleClick = async () => {
          await Tone.start();
          setIsAudioReady(true);
        };
        
        return (
          <button onClick={handleClick} disabled={isAudioReady}>
            {isAudioReady ? 'Audio Ready' : 'Start Audio'}
          </button>
        );
      };
      ```
    - Use a context or state management solution to track audio initialization status across components
    - Ensure all audio-related functionality is gated behind the audio initialization:
      ```typescript
      const playNote = (frequency: number) => {
        if (Tone.context.state === 'running' && synth) {
          synth.triggerAttackRelease(frequency, '0.5');
        } else {
          console.warn('Audio not initialized. Please start audio first.');
        }
      };
      ```
    - Use Tone.Transport for precise timing of audio events
    - Implement a master volume control using Tone.Master
    - Use Tone.js' built-in effects for audio processing when possible
    - Implement proper disposal of Tone.js objects when they are no longer needed

15. Audio Initialization and Management:
    - Always initialize Tone.js context after user interaction to comply with browser autoplay policies
    - Use a custom hook (e.g., useAudio) to manage audio state and initialization across components
    - Implement proper cleanup of audio resources when components unmount
    - Use React's useRef hook to store Tone.js objects to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    - Implement a centralized audio state management system (e.g., using Context API) to track audio initialization status across the application

16. Error Handling and Debugging:
    - Implement comprehensive error handling for audio-related operations
    - Use try-catch blocks for async operations, especially those involving audio initialization
    - Provide clear error messages to users when audio operations fail
    - Implement logging for audio-related events and errors to aid in debugging
    - Use browser developer tools to monitor audio context state and performance
    - Implement feature detection for Web Audio API support

17. Mobile and Cross-Browser Compatibility:
    - Test audio functionality across different browsers and devices
    - Implement fallback strategies for browsers with limited Web Audio API support
    - Handle touch events for mobile devices in addition to mouse events
    - Optimize audio performance for mobile devices by limiting polyphony and using efficient audio processing techniques
    - Implement responsive design for audio controls and visualizations

# Tone.js usage tips:

1. Accurate Timing

Tone.js uses the Web Audio API for sample-accurate scheduling. If you are experiencing loose timing, double check that you are passing in the scheduled time the Transport provides into the event that you are scheduling:

INCORRECT:
```
Transport.schedule(() => {
  player.start();
}, 0);
```

CORRECT:
```
Transport.schedule((time) => {
  player.start(time);
}, 0);
```

Event Classes
This is similarly true for all of the event classes like Part, Sequence, Loop, Pattern, etc.

INCORRECT:
```
new Part((time, event) => {
  synth.triggerAttackRelease(event.note, event.duration);
}, events);
```

CORRECT:
```
new Part((time, event) => {
  synth.triggerAttackRelease(event.note, event.duration, time);
}, events);
```

2. Ensure you are preventing the "Max polyphony exceeded" error by properly managing and disposing of Tone.js objects when they are no longer needed.

3. Handle note names correctly:
   - Tone.js uses '#' for sharps and 'b' for flats.
   - Clean up note names before passing them to Tone.js functions:
```
const cleanNoteName = (note: string) => {
return note.replace('♯', '#').replace('♭', 'b').split('/')[0];
};
// Usage
synth.triggerAttackRelease(cleanNoteName(noteName) + '4', '0.5');
```
