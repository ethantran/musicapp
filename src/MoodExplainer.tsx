            <h3>Major vs Minor Scales</h3>
            <p>The terms 'major' and 'minor' refer to the mood of a scale:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major scales</strong> generally sound happy, bright, and lively. They are commonly used in pop music.</li>
                <li><strong>Minor scales</strong> generally sound sad, dark, and thoughtful. They are often used in blues and emotional music.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This difference in mood is due to the specific pattern of intervals between the notes in each scale.</p>
        </div>
