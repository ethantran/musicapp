            <h4>Synthetic Scales</h4>
            <p>Synthetic scales are created by altering existing scales chromatically or adding notes from the chromatic scale. This results in unique scales with varied numbers of notes, often used in jazz and experimental music.</p>

            <h4>Harmonic Centers</h4>
            <p>There are twelve possible harmonic centers (or root notes) for any scale, corresponding to the twelve notes in music. This means each scale can be played starting from any of these twelve notes, creating different modes or variations of the scale.</p>

            <h4>Scale Varieties</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5-note scales:</strong> Pentatonic scales (e.g., minor pentatonic, major pentatonic)</li>
                <li><strong>7-note scales:</strong> Diatonic scales (e.g., major, natural minor), Harmonic minor, Melodic minor</li>
                <li><strong>8-note scales:</strong> Bebop scales (used in jazz)</li>
                <li><strong>Other scales:</strong> Can have any number of notes up to 11 (or theoretically 12, which would be the full chromatic scale)</li>
            </ul>
